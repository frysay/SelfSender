# SelfSender
General Info: It's an Android app that sends sms or email on its own when or where you want. It gives you the possibility of chosing between 3 options to trigger the sending: at a given location, at a given time and date or a combination of both. The last option has been made to allow a better power saving in case you already know the date and an approximation of the time of when you should reach given location.

Purpose: The reason I've done this app is to practice in Android and sum up a bit of random knowledge learned in this period I've been developing with it. I hope that this can help other people that need to use these kind of features. That's why I've tried to develop everything hardly using the same way even for the same kind of problems. Sometimes some part of the code could look useless or not efficient but that wasn't the purpose why I've developed it. For example there is no need to use the Wake_lock in wakerup.java or to put MyBroadcastReceiver as inner class of ShowStoredMessages.java.

Note: To try out the app you can just download the SelfSender.apk in bin. Remember I've removed the ACCESS_MOCK_LOCATION permission in the manifest.

Any questions or suggestions are welcome. I'm eager to learn and to improve as much as possible, and of course, if possible, to help others with what I know.
